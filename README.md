# $PEDRO Token Website

Welcome to the official repository of the $PEDRO token website - the most awkwardly amazing token on the Solana blockchain!

This repository contains a GitHub Pages website with a static homepage and a React-based memes page.

## About

$PEDRO is a community-driven meme token inspired by the iconic "Monkey Puppet" meme. Our mission is to bring the power of awkward moments to the blockchain, one side-eye at a time.

## Project Structure

- `homepage/`: Static homepage built with Vite
- `memes/`: React application for the memes page
- `docs/`: Build output directory for GitHub Pages deployment

## Development

### Homepage

```bash
cd homepage
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Memes Page

```bash
cd memes
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

To build both projects for production:

1. Build the homepage:

```bash
cd homepage
npm run build
```

2. Build the memes page:

```bash
cd memes
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `docs/` directory, ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser
- Sense of humor
- Ability to handle awkward situations
